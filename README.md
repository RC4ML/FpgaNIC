# FpgaNIC
FpgaNIC is an FPGA-based, GPU-centric, versatile SmartNIC  
1, that enables direct PCIe P2P communication with local GPUs using GPU virtual address, 
2, that provides reliable 100Gb network access to remote GPUs, and 
3, that allows to offload various complex compute tasks to a customized data-path accelerator for line-rate in-network computing on the FPGA, thereby complementing the processing at the GPU.
